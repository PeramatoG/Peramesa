Adjust channel levels and mutes as needed in each send.

Double-click the bottom label of a channel to toggle between:
    - Gray, which indicates that channel will NOT be sent to the mixer.
    - Orange, which indicates that this channel WILL be sent to the mixer when requested.

When any channel property changes, the bottom label turns orange to indicate
those channel values will be sent to the mixer.
